"problem statement"
'''In an e-commerce company, the management wants to predict
whether a customer will purchase a high-value product based
on their age, time spent on the website, and whether they
have added items to their cart. The goal is to optimize
marketing strategies by targeting potential customers more 
effectively, thereby increasing sales and revenue.'''

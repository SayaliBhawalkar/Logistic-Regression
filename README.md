Problem Statement:
"In an e-commerce company, the management wants to predict
whether a customer will purchase a high-value product based
on their age, time spent on the website, and whether they
have added items to their cart. The goal is to optimize
marketing strategies by targeting potential customers more 
effectively, thereby increasing sales and revenue."

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, making it an ideal choice for this scenario where the outcome is categorical:

0: The customer does not purchase the high-value product.

1: The customer purchases the high-value product.

Logistic Regression Model:
The logistic regression model predicts the probability that a customer belongs to one of the two categories based on input features.

Steps to Solve:

1.Data Collection: Gather customer data including age, time spent on the website, and cart activity.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical data if needed.

3.Model Training: Fit the logistic regression model using a training dataset with historical data.

4.Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

5.Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a high-value product.

Benefits:

.Targeted Marketing: Focus efforts on customers with a high probability of purchasing, improving ROI.

.Efficiency: Simple to implement and interpret.

.Insights: Provides clear information on how features like age and cart activity influence purchasing behavior.

Challenges:

Data Quality: Poor data quality may lead to unreliable predictions.

Feature Selection: Irrelevant features can reduce model performance.

Imbalance: If the dataset is imbalanced (e.g., significantly more non-buyers than buyers), specialized techniques like SMOTE or class weighting may be needed.
